# deepKNet
PointNet-based 3D deep learning model designed for decoding the structure-property relationship for generic crystalline materials.


The materials-data generator which fetches data from the Materials Project and computes the 3D X-ray diffraction patterns will become publicly available once our manuscript comes online.

Readers with interest should directly contact the corresponding author Raymond Wang for more information and we are open for collaborations.
